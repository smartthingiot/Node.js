# Node.js

### ðŸ’¡ What is Node.js?

[Node.js](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/nodejs-tutorials/) is a platform built on Chromeâ€™s `JavaScript` v8 engine, which is used for easily building fast and scalable network applications. 

`Javascript` aka `js` uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient to make use of the tools (or packages) in `Node. js`, we need to be able to install in our machine and manage them in a useful way. 

This is where `NPM`, the `Node package manager`, comes in to play and it contains default packages and also allows us to install external packages in our project.
